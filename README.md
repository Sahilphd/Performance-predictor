# Performance-predictor

The dataset file contains training accuracy, training loss, validation accuracy and validation accuracy corresponding to 5 epochs for 14 benchmark CNN models executed on 20 different plant disease datasets. Further the last column contains the maximum validation accuracy obtained by the respecitve full-blown training executions. This dataset can be used to train performance predictors such that the sub-optimal models could get discarded without the requirement of training them to convergence.
